# Audio Transcription & Keypoint Extraction App 🎤➡️📝

This project is currently **in progress**.  
The goal is to build a web application that automatically transcribes uploaded audio files and extracts the key points from the text.  

## 🚀 Overview
- **Speech-to-Text**: Audio files are transcribed using [OpenAI Whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny.en).  
- **Keypoint Extraction**: The transcribed text is passed to an [IBM Watsonx LLM](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx) (e.g., LLAMA2) to extract key points and details.  
- **Web Interface**: With [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), users can easily upload audio files and view results directly in the browser.  

## 📂 Project Status
🔧 The project is **not finished yet**.  
- Some configurations (e.g., **API key** and **Project ID** for IBM Watsonx) are still missing.  
- Documentation, setup instructions, and screenshots will be **added later**.  

## 📋 ToDo
- [ ] Configure IBM Watsonx credentials  
- [ ] Write full setup and installation guide  
- [ ] Document example workflow  
- [ ] Add screenshots and demo examples  

## ⚠️ Note
This repository is a **Work in Progress**.  
More details and step-by-step instructions will be added soon.
